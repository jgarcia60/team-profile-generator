# team-profile-generator

## Description 

This project designed a work team profile from a command line interface. This project uses the node "Inquirer" package to prompt the user for questions to create employee objects, which are then used to write to an html file. 

The necessary classes and objects were created by test driven development. Jest test files were used to develop the correct constructors for extensions of the Employee object.

Code abstraction was also practiced to implement several methods for adding different employees to your team profile.

## Installation

Here is the link to the webpage:

https://jgarcia60.github.io/team-profile-generator

To install the project files, you can clone the "team-profile-generator" repository which contains the necessary files at https://github.com/jgarcia60/team-profile-generator by clicking the green drop down "Code" and cloning the repo with an SSH key. To run the command line interface app, you will need to run "node app.js" in the correct directory in your terminal. Then your created team profile html will be generated in the "output" folder.


## Usage 

You may use this code to learn about using the Inquirer npm package to create a command line interface application, or as a tool to learn about using node.js, creating and extending object classes, and writing files, and learning how to use jest for test driven development.
